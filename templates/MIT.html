{document.getElementById("text").innerHTML="I can honestly say that I participate in teaching for the pleasure of it. Rather than call it pleasure though it's more of the sudden look of understanding that comes upon a younger student's face that is the best part.... if that makes sense. The best proof of this is that I'm magically able to arrive half an hour early to it while for many other things i'm a good ten minutes late despite my efforts &gt;_&lt;. I'm not part of the clubs that run the activities, but via some smiling and dedication I'm able to participate in almost all of them - one was closed to members of the club :(. As a result Im one of the leaders for an invitational were running in January where we invite middle schoolers to participate in an Odyssey of the Mind style competition, and was one of the senior coaches last week when teaching Proofs to a different set of middle schoolers I think the part where we literally skipped around the school doing math problems was the best part :). (Of course Ill be requesting leave to come and participate in this again and will be part of the MIT Educational Studies Program during the Summer!)";}

{document.getElementById("text").innerHTML="So I have two things for this: perseverance - one of more typical ones, and randomness (but not really entropy)!<br> <br>I am a persevering individual and strive to excel in all aspects of life, from academic success, to personal relationships. My journey through scouting has introduced me to the excitement of travel, camping, and archery. I held the position of Patrol leader, librarian, troop guide and den chief over my scouting journey which reinforced my leadership and perseverance skills. I learnt essential life skills like resilience and flexibility during my struggle with unforeseen weather predicaments while climbing Old Rag and experiencing exciting canoeing adventures. On one of my hiking expeditions we were halfway up the mountain when extreme heat, diminishing water supplies and medical conditions (foot sores) caused half of the Scouting group to turn back. I rallied to team members to keep going; after all accomplishing difficult missions under dire conditions was part of the Scout goals. It was a challenge we had completed half way and perseverance was part of the Scout law! I believe this demonstrated endurance and the ability to persevere with the task I had started, a quality that kept me stoic in moments of a family medical crisis last year when my mom needed my assistance on financial matters, handyman tasks and from the emotional support perspective. In addition,<br>I am proud of my bookishness, though I admit it occasionally distracts from school assignments. By reading everything I find, I learn more for the sheer sake of knowing; if it's in a foreign language, that just means more to learn - the physicist Landau was Polish! (yes I have a picture of a stack of books almost my height, if anyone wants it xD)<br><br>Randomness:<br>I let out a disappointing sigh in defeat as another person walked away. I simply had to wait for another one to come. &quot;Hey, this is crazy, but what's up!?&quot; A smile sat on my face as I scanned the newcomer. He wondered why I, a nondescript person in the hall had called out as he walked<br>by, a seemingly random coincidence or was it? For him maybe, for me not at all; by that time I was an aspiring amateur learning the ways of approaching strangers. Socrates said that if you're the smartest in the room, you're in the wrong room. My take is slightly different: if you're bored, you must be in a room by yourself. I find it fun to meet strangers; if you never approach them, you're missing out on a whole group of people! Last week I walked up to a girl during a fire drill; she looked like my friend and had the same last name on the back of her sweatshirt. When she turned around, I was shocked. I found out that my new friend had that happen frequently and learned a bit about someone new! :). YUP. I'll be randomly walking around MIT saying &quot;HI&quot; and smiling! Yup - even when i shadow (which is 12/7)... though I need to get a shirt that says free hugs also since that sounds fun :D !";}

{document.getElementById("text").innerHTML="CS! I love doing computer science and thinking of clever solutions to<br>problems.. though I admit, I also try to play the &quot;how short can I make this<br>code game&quot;... (I've spent quite a bit trying to get an A* Search to 10 lines<br>in Python... I'm at 11 and stuck on how to compress a while loop -&gt;<br>everything else is compressed in a giant set of 4-deep nested list<br>comprehensions &gt;:D ). So I love doing computer science because it's elegance<br>- I think pretty code can easily rival a math proof, it's &quot;level&quot; - no matter<br>how complicated your algorithm or how complicated the proof behind it is,<br>when it comes down to it, its one language free of special notations and<br>comes in a complete package, no needed lemmas. Most likely though, it";}

{document.getElementById("text").innerHTML="Bring-Bring. Somewhere in the background I hear a telephone; &quot;Don't pick it <br>up!&quot; my dad shouts; this is common by now as it's not an actual call but a <br>modem. A year or two later we're using broadband and I'm not sure why we ever <br>used a modem. At dinner I hear things like &quot;I'm working on a new project&quot; and <br>&quot;waterfall and agile paradigms&quot;, somehow these connect with company names <br>such as &quot;MCI&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot;. I don't really know how but the word IT jumps <br>into the mix headfirst now as well. My dad has a degree as an electrical <br>engineer while my mom has hers in economics; where does &quot;Waterfall&quot; come <br>into that? <br>I find out later it doesn't. It's actually one of the different software <br>development cycle ideas. At maybe 10 I see my dad feverishly talking on a <br>phone, my mom says to my grandmother: 'they had an attack at work'. In my <br>mind this means dashing villains backwards flipping into sports cars with <br>swarms of police at the back. Nope, wrong again; it meant an intrusion; a <br>cybersecurity attack. This may be how I picked up my idea of swimming &acirc;?&brvbar; into <br>source code as an idea of fun; or it might be when I decided one of my <br>computer games was boring and I could make it better. Somehow now though, I <br>find myself coding if I need to do small things ~ copy and rename a bunch of <br>files, or writing a small script to output vector fields for physics. When <br>asked about it, I find myself saying it's more of a fun thing rather than <br>work; only somehow I've now found as an intern at MITRE, it's somehow work as <br>well.";}

{document.getElementById("text").innerHTML="So for this I have two things: a slight challenge and a fun solution... to two different things. I would like to touch on both! Sorry if things don't come out very well - much like the MIT interview I consider essays casual conversations.<br><br>For the first:<br><br>A challenge I live with is recurrent migraines. In my junior year in Thomas Jefferson, when grades and extracurricular balance were of paramount importance, my dad was paralyzed with Guillain Barre Syndrome. While he was suddenly hanging on to life, my mom was frantic with emotional and financial worries, my brother seemed sullen and uncooperative and I experienced, for the first time, unbearable headaches called &quot;migraines&quot;. <br>This meant a pain when there was talking... repetitive music, or even bright lights. When not visiting my dad, nausea kept me hidden in my dark bedroom. School absences prompted doctor recommendations ranging from prescription pills to inhalers that knocked me out.<br><br>My migraines manifest as a pulsating pain on one side of the head, though they are happy to bounce around like a pinball machine. The doctors told me migraines are triggered by factors like stress, not unusual given my dad's situation but not helpful given my situation.<br>If I had to attribute to the experience a lesson, it would be the power to accept.  I had to accept living with my condition and my family's emergency situation the best way possible. After all, what does not kill you makes you stronger ... and hungry. I helped my mom the best I could, drank lots of water, ate more fruits and vegetables, and maintained a journal of migraine triggers. This year, my dad is partially recovered, my migraines are less frequent, and I am beginning to fully manage them.<br><br>For the second:<br>Last year when participating in TJ Spontaneous Invitational, organizing a room of loud children and surprisingly sometimes parents, the main event was pushed back by three hours; it seemed that many of the staff and even teams showed up late. This meant that suddenly all of the rooms were overfilled and a few hours behind schedule. Ironically I had a fun time organizing with coaches and other rooms to push the thing back on schedule ~ as a result it's now my job for the TJ 2013 Invitiational :D.";}
