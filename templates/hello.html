<p>
sorry - I haven't made a main page yet.... but Hello World! :D
</p>
<p>
Its ok though, the other links work ex. something.com/test OH and they have graphics better than this plain text page... like CSS AND JAVASCRIPT :) !
</p>
right now there are the following: 
<ul><li><a href="/dino">/dino:</a> because dinos are awesome</li>
<li><a href="/sigma">/sigma:</a>I used a small visualization tool for structured data. Right now it's running off of an anime database. It can be made to do active queries, but I don't want to overquery the website, so right now it's using a stable dataset.</li>
 <li><a href="/college">/college:</a> surprise!</li>
<li><a href="/reader">/reader:</a>because I can say what I read... or you can just import the xml file from my google reader which really shows what I read - and showing is better than telling!...really though it is better to just import it into a feed reader - I use google reader typically. Tons of XML data is not easy to read</li>
</ul></p>

these are sort of works in progress :P. Next goal is building a rudimentary Go (the game) player using HMMs as that sounds fun!
<p>
 so www.graphvis.heroku.com/reader for the last one!'
